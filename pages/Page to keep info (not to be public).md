<p>Under SIRA, the Minister is allowed to exercise oversight over ownership
or control changes involving parties in positions to influence and direct
the actions of the designated entities.</p>
<p>Notification or approval obligations will be imposed on prospective controllers,
existing controllers, and designated entities; based on specific thresholds
that may take reference from existing sectoral legislation. These thresholds
may be varied on an entity-by-entity basis. If applicable, they will be
prescribed in subsidiary legislation.</p>
<p>The notification or approval obligations will not apply retroactively,
but only to new ownership or control changes after the entities have been
designated.</p>
<p>Should prospective or existing controllers proceed with the transactions
without seeking the necessary prior approvals from Minister, the transactions
are automatically rendered void.</p>
