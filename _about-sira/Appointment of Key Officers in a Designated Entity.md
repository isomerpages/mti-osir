partnership; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A partner of a designated entity that is a partnership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In assessing whether the appointment of a key officer should be approved,
the Minister may consider factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Honesty, integrity and reputation;</p>
</li>
