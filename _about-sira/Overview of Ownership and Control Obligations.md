<p><strong>Overview of Ownership and Control Obligations</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&lt;I think we can drop all this text and jump straight to the infographic to minimise repetition, but please save this text somewhere in case we need to reinsert it in future&gt;</strong> Under
SIRA, the Minister is allowed to exercise oversight over ownership or control
changes involving parties in positions to influence and direct the actions
of the designated entities.</p>
<p>Notification or approval obligations will be imposed on prospective controllers,
existing controllers, and designated entities; based on specific thresholds
that may take reference from existing sectoral legislation. These thresholds
may be varied on an entity-by-entity basis. If applicable, they will be
prescribed in subsidiary legislation.</p>
<p>The notification or approval obligations will not apply retroactively,
but only to new ownership or control changes after the entities have been
designated.</p>
<p>Should prospective or existing controllers proceed with the transactions
without seeking the necessary prior approvals from Minister, the transactions
are automatically rendered void.</p>

of a designated entity that is a corporation;</p>

<p><strong>Removal of key officers in a designated entity</strong>
</p>
<p>Under section 28 of SIRA, if a key officer of a designated entity was
appointed without the necessary approval, or if any condition of approval
has been breached, the appointed key officer can be removed. The Minister
can also remove any key officer if deemed necessary in the interest of
national security.</p>
