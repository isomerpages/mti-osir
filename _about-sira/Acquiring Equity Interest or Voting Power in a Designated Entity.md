<p>Parties will need to notify or seek approval if they are involved in transactions
that meet the prescribed thresholds for the designated entities.</p>
<p>The default obligations are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Notifying the Minister within 7 calendar days of becoming a 5% controller
in a designated entity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeking the Ministerâ€™s approval prior to becoming a 12%, 25%, or 50% controller
in a designated entity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the above are default thresholds set out in the Act, the Minister
has the flexibility to vary such thresholds for specific entities as the
situation warrants, and if so, these will be prescribed in subsidiary legislation.</p>
<p>Parties may seek clarification from OSIR at <a href="mailto:contact@osir.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>contact@osir.gov.sg</u></a> before
the commencement of any formal application.</p>
