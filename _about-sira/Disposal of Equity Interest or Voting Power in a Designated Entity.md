<p>Parties will need to seek approval from the Minister prior to disposing
equity interest or voting power in a designated entity which will result
in them ceasing to be a 50% or 75% controller.</p>
<p>While the above are default thresholds set out in the Act, the Minister
has the flexibility to vary such thresholds for specific entities as the
situation warrants, and if so, these will be prescribed in subsidiary legislation.</p>
<p>Kindly refer to the step-by-step process below on disposing equity interest
or voting power in a designated entity.</p>
<p>Parties may seek clarification from OSIR at <a href="mailto:contact@osir.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>contact@osir.gov.sg</u></a> before
the commencement of any formal application.</p>
