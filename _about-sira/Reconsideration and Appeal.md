<p>SIRA is designed to be business-friendly and sets out clear processes
for parties that wish to seek reconsideration from Minister for his decisions,
and to make further appeals to an independent Reviewing Tribunal.</p>
<h4><strong>Reconsideration requests</strong></h4>
<p>Parties may submit a reconsideration application against decisions, remedial
directions or orders issued by the Minister for Trade &amp; Industry or
the Relevant Minister.</p>
<p>Parties are to submit the <a href="https://www.osir.gov.sg/forms/reconsideration-and-appeal-forms/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">reconsideration form</a> via
email to <a href="mailto:submissions@osir.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">submissions@osir.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p>The Minister's decision must be complied with and remains in effect until
it is cancelled or substituted on reconsideration. No further reconsideration
can be made after Minister makes a decision on the reconsideration application.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Appeals</strong></h4>
<p>Should parties wish to further appeal against the Minister's reconsideration
decision, appeals to an independent Reviewing Tribunal must be submitted
within 30 calendar days of a reconsideration decision.</p>
<p>Parties may find the appeal form on <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/SIRA/Significant-Investments-Review-Act" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MTI website</a> and
submit the form via email to <a href="mailto:secretary@siratribunal.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">secretary@siratribunal.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p>The Minister's reconsideration decision remains in effect until it is
reversed on appeal. The Reviewing Tribunal's decision is final.</p>
