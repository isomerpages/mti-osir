<p>SIRA is designed to be business-friendly and sets out clear processes
for parties that wish to seek reconsideration from Minister for his decisions,
and to make further appeals to an independent Reviewing Tribunal.</p>
<h4><strong>Reconsideration requests</strong></h4>
<p>Parties may submit a reconsideration application against decisions, remedial
directions or orders issued by the Minister for Trade &amp; Industry or
the Relevant Minister.</p>
<p>The Minister's decision must be complied with and remains in effect until
it is cancelled or substituted on reconsideration. No further reconsideration
can be made after Minister makes a decision on the reconsideration application.
A decision, remedial direction or order issued by the Minister for Trade
&amp; Industry or the Relevant Minister remains in effect, despite any
reconsideration application made, until it is suspended, varied, or cancelled
(as the case may be).</p>
<h4><strong>Appeals</strong></h4>
<p>Parties may wish to further appeal against the Minister's reconsideration
decision to an independent Reviewing Tribunal <strong><u>within 30 calendar days</u></strong> of
reconsideration decision.</p>
<p>The Minister's reconsideration decision remains in effect until it is
reversed on appeal. A Reviewing Tribunal's decision is final.</p>
