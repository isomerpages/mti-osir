<label for="accordion2">Why is there a need to designate my entity?</label><div>  
<p>We regularly review the efficacy of our safeguards to protect critical sectors and entities.</p>  
		<p>Global developments in recent years have reinforced the importance of economic resilience. There is increasing need to screen for malicious actions effected through investments in critical entities.</p>

<label for="accordion3">How do I know what are the compliance requirements? Who do I contact if I have questions?</label><div>  
<p>You may contact the <a href="/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Office of Significant Investments Review</a> to guide you through the compliance requirements and assist with your queries.</p>

<label for="accordion5"> Will my entity be doubly-regulated under SIRB and sectoral legislation? How will SIRB interact with sectoral legislation? </label><div>
	<p> While sectoral licensees will not themselves be designated entities, they may be subject to provisions under SIRB if they are key shareholders of designated entities. In such cases, all relevant approvals under SIRB will have to be obtained before a particular transaction can proceed. </p>
<p> Where a subsidiary of an entity under sectoral legislation is designated under SIRB it may be possible to align any ownership and control provisions under SIRB with those of the sectoral legislation to reduce any regulatory burden on the parent company. </p>
