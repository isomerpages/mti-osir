<p>The Significant Investments Review Act (SIRA) sits alongside other existing
sectoral legislation with ownership and control provisions in Singapore.</p>
<p>SIRA complements existing sectoral legislation by regulating entities
which are not adequately covered under sectoral legislation. The following
table provides a non-exhaustive overview of sectoral legislation in Singapore
that contains ownership and control provisions. It is not intended to serve
as a comprehensive list of all applicable legislation in Singapore. You
may wish to seek independent legal advice or consult professionals who
have experience with these obligations.</p>
