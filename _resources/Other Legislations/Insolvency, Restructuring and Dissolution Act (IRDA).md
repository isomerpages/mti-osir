<p>The Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 ("IRDA") is an
omnibus Act that covers corporate and personal insolvency and debt restructuring
laws.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under Section 126(1)(n), the Court may order the winding up of the company
if the company "is being used for an unlawful purpose or for purposes prejudicial
to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore or against national
security or interest".</p>
<p></p>
<p>If it is the Minister for Finance who is applying to wind up a company
on the aforementioned ground, the Minister may also apply under section
125(5) for orders, pending the hearing of the winding up application, to
restrain the company and its directors, officers and employees from carrying
out specfied activities. Contravention of such orders is an offence punishable
with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 2 years
or both. The full text of the IRDA is available at <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/IRDA2018" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
