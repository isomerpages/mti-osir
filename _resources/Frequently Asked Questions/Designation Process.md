<p>Unless considered to be not practicable or desirable to do so, before
the Minister designates any entity, notice will be given to the entity
of the Minister’s intent to designate it and the entity will be given at
least 14 days after the date of the notice to make representations on the
proposed designation.
<br>Once a designation is made, as far as practicable, the Minister will notify
the designated entity and any other parties who, in the Minister’s opinion,
ought to have notice of the designation. Any designation, or cancellation
of designation, will be notified in the Gazette.</p>

<p>Parties can seek reconsideration from the Minister within 14 days after
his decisions; after which, they may appeal to a Reviewing Tribunal within
30 days after the reconsideration outcome.
