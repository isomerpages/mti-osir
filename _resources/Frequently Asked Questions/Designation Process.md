<ul>
<li>
<p>Which entities have been designated?</p>
<p>All designation of entities will be notified in the Gazette. OSIR also
maintains and publishes an updated list of designated entities at &lt;OSIR
website – Designated Entities subpage&gt;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the considerations in designating an entity?</p>
<p>Designation is not a process treated lightly and is only done when deemed
necessary in the interests of Singapore’s national security. Various factors
will be taken into consideration in deciding which entities should be considered
for designation. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Whether the entity provides a critical function in relation to Singapore’s
national security interests; and</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Whether the entity is adequately covered by sectoral legislation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Should a designated entity subsequently cease to meet these criteria,
cancellation of its designation may be possible.</p>

<p>How do I know what are the compliance requirements? Who do I contact if
I have questions?</p>
<p>You may contact the <a href="/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Office of Significant Investments Review</a> to guide
you through the compliance requirements and assist with your queries.</p>
<p>Any enquiries or clarifications which businesses or investors may have
prior to the commencement of any formal application are welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will my entity be doubly-regulated under SIRB and sectoral legislation?
How will SIRB interact with sectoral legislation?</p>
<p>While sectoral licensees will not themselves be designated entities, they
may be subject to provisions under SIRB if they are key shareholders of
designated entities. In such cases, all relevant approvals under SIRB will
have to be obtained before a particular transaction can proceed.</p>
<p>Where a subsidiary of an entity under sectoral legislation is designated
under SIRB it may be possible to align any ownership and control provisions
under SIRB with those of the sectoral legislation to reduce any regulatory
burden on the parent company.</p>
