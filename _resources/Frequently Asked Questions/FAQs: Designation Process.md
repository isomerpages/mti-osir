<summary>What are the considerations in designating an entity?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Designation is not a process treated lightly and will only be done, if
necessary, in the interest of Singapore’s national security.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Various factors will be taken into consideration in deciding which entities
should be considered for designation. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Whether the entity provides a critical function in relation to Singapore’s
national security interests, such as the delivery of essential goods or
services to Singapore; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the entity is adequately covered by sectoral legislation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Should a designated entity subsequently cease to meet these criteria,
cancellation of its designation may be possible.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What is the designation process?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Unless considered to be not practicable or desirable to do so, before
the Minister designates any entity, notice will be given to the entity
of the Minister’s intent to designate it and the entity will be given at
least 14 calendar days after the date of the notice to make representations
on the proposed designation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once a designation is made, as far as practicable, the Minister will notify
the designated entity and any other parties who, in the Minister’s opinion,
ought to have notice of the designation. Any designation, or cancellation
of designation, will be notified in the <a href="https://www.egazette.com.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Gazette</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parties can seek reconsideration from the Minister within 14 calendar
days after his decisions; after which, they may appeal to a Reviewing Tribunal
within 30 calendar days after the reconsideration outcome.
