<summary>What is the timeline for the Minister to arrive at a reconsideration outcome,
or for the Reviewing Tribunal to make its decision on an appeal?</summary>

<p>Given that there may be diverse and complex considerations relating to
national security concerns, decision-making authorities should be allowed
adequate time to conduct thorough assessments and properly review the case
before them.&nbsp;
<br>

<p>Nonetheless, we will endeavour to process all applications for reconsideration
and appeals expeditiously.&nbsp;</p>
