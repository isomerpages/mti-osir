<p>The Significant Investments Review Act has been designed to be business-friendly.

Reconsideration applications and appeals can be submitted for all decisions, directions or orders issued, except for the certificate issued by the Minister charged with the responsibility for internal security that states that the Minister is satisfied that the entity has acted against our national security interests.</p></div>

<label for="accordion2">What is the process for submitting a reconsideration application and are there any fees?</label><div>  
<p>Parties may seek reconsideration from the Minister within 14 calendar days after receiving the decision. They may use the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osir.gov.sg/forms/reconsideration-and-appeal-forms" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reconsideration Application Form </a> and email the completed form to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:submissions@osir.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">submissions@osir.gov.sg</a>.</p>

There are no fees payable when submitting a reconsideration application.

The Minister's decision must be complied with and remains in effect until it is cancelled or substituted on reconsideration. No further reconsideration can be made after Minister makes a decision on the reconsideration application.

<label for="accordion3">What is the process for submitting an appeal and are there any fees?</label><div>  
<p>Parties aggrieved by either an initial appealable decision affirmed on reconsideration, or a substitute appealable decision made on reconsideration may appeal to an independent Reviewing Tribunal within 30 calendar days after the reconsideration decision.

Parties will be required to pay the prescribed appeal fee of $200 as part of the application.

Appellants may use the relevant form available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/SIRA/Significant-Investments-Review-Act" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">MTI website</a>&nbsp;and email the completed form to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:secretary@siratribunal.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">secretary@siratribunal.gov.sg</a>. 

The Minister's reconsideration decision remains in effect until it is reversed on appeal. The Reviewing Tribunal's decision is final.

</li><li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion4">  
<label for="accordion4">What is the composition of the Reviewing Tribunal?</label><div>  
<p>Each Reviewing Tribunal will consist of three individuals, appointed by the President on the advice of the Cabinet, including a chairperson who is a Supreme Court judge.</p></div>

</li><li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion5">  
<label for="accordion5">What is the timeline for the Minister to arrive at a reconsideration outcome, or for the Reviewing Tribunal to make its decision on an appeal?</label><div>  
<p>Given that there may be diverse and complex considerations relating to national security concerns, decision-making authorities should be allowed adequate time to conduct thorough assessments and properly review the case before them.&nbsp;

</p><p>Nonetheless, we will endeavour to process all applications for reconsideration and appeal expeditiously.</p></div>
