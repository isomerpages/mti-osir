<label for="accordion7">Is notification or approval needed if a party is investing into a holding company of a designated entity?</label><div>
	
<p>Whether an intermediate holding company or an ultimate parent company will be subject to the ownership and control obligations in the Act is fact-specific, depending on the extent and nature of control they have in the designated entity.</p>

<p>For example, where an intermediate holding company or an ultimate parent company owner’s total investment holding reaches a prescribed threshold, the relevant notification or approval obligations may apply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The obligations of a potential investor, intermediate holding company or an ultimate parent company to notify or seek approval apply regardless of whether the actions were the result of the intermediate holding company, the ultimate parent company or any other party.</p>

<label for="accordion8">What are the obligations of the parent entities of designated entities?</label><div>

<p> Only obligations related to changes in direct ownership or control specifically apply to parent entities.

<p>Similarly, if a parent entity seeks to increase its shareholding in a designated entity which causes it to cross a prescribed threshold as a result, prior approval would be required.</p>

<label for="accordion10">Does a party need to notify or seek approval when acquiring an equity interest if there is no intention to vote or exercise control over the designated entity?</label><div>

<p>Any party investing in a designated entity, whether they seek control over the designated entity or otherwise, must comply with the obligations under the Significant Investments Review Act if they meet the prescribed thresholds. </p>

<p>Parties may refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osir.gov.sg/about-sira/overview-of-ownership-and-control-obligations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Overview of Ownership &amp; Control Obligations under SIRA </a> for the prescribed thresholds.

<label for="accordion11">Does a party need to seek approval for the acquisition of equity interest which is exercisable only in the future (e.g. convertible loan, or options)?</label><div>

<p>Under the Significant Investments Review Act, a party will be deemed to have equity interest as long as it has the right to acquire the equity interest or voting power. </p>

<p>This may arise under an option, convertible loan or other arrangement where the equity interest is transferred to (or to the order of) the party, regardless of when the right is exercisable and whether there are conditions tied to it.</p>

<p>Hence, a party entering into any such arrangement will need to notify or seek approval if the equity interest meets the prescribed thresholds.</p>
