<p>Parties will need to notify or seek approval if they are involved in transactions that meet the prescribed thresholds for the designated entities.</p>  
  
<p>The default obligations are:</p>

<ul><li><p></p>Notifying the Minister within 7 calendar days after becoming a 5% controller in a designated entity; and </li><p></p>
<li><p></p>Seeking the Ministerâ€™s approval before becoming a 12%, 25%, or 50% controller in a designated entity. </li><p></p>

<p>While the above are default thresholds set out in the Significant Investments Review Act, the Minister has the flexibility to vary such thresholds for specific entities as the situation warrants, and if so, these will be prescribed in subsidiary legislation.</p>
