<summary>Is notification or approval needed if a party is investing into a holding
company of a designated entity?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Whether an intermediate holding company or an ultimate parent company
will be subject to the ownership and control obligations in the Bill is
fact-specific, depending on the extent and nature of control they have
in the designated entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>For example, where an intermediate holding company or an ultimate parent
company owner’s total investment holding reaches a prescribed threshold,
the relevant notification or approval obligations may apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>The obligations of a potential investor, intermediate holding company
or an ultimate parent company to notify or seek approval apply regardless
of whether the actions were the result of the intermediate holding company,
the ultimate parent company or any other party.&nbsp;</p>

<summary>What are the obligations of the parent entities of designated entities?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Only obligations related to changes in direct ownership or control specifically
apply to parent entities. For example, if a parent entity seeks to sell
off some of its shares in the designated entity and would fall below a
prescribed threshold as a result, prior approval would be required for
the sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>Similarly, if a parent entity seeks to increase its shareholding in a
designated entity which causes it to cross a prescribed threshold as a
result, prior approval would be required.</p>

<summary>Does a party need to seek approval for the acquisition of equity interest
which is exercisable only in the future (e.g. convertible loan, or options)?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Under the Significant Investments Review Act, a party will be deemed to
have equity interest as long as it has the right to acquire the equity
interest or voting power.</p>

<br>This may arise under an option, convertible loan or other arrangement
where the equity interest is transferred to (or to the order of) the party,
regardless of when the right is exercisable and whether there are conditions
tied to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>Hence, a party entering into any such arrangement will need to notify
or seek approval if the equity interest meets the prescribed thresholds.</p>
