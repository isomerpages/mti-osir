<summary>Does the Act apply to entities that are not designated? If so, when do
the powers under the Act apply?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Act applies to entities that are not designated, but only when the
following two criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The entity has acted against Singapore’s national security interests;
and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There has been a transaction which resulted in changes to the entity’s
ownership or control within the two years prior to the above-mentioned
action by the entity against our national security interests.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Currently, there are already existing laws to deal with egregious acts
against national security. For example, under the Insolvency, Restructuring
and Dissolution Act, the Court may order the winding up of a company if
it is being used against Singapore’s national security.&nbsp; However,
winding up an entity could affect the continued provisioning of its functions,
and may not be the desired outcome.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The powers under the Significant Investments Review Act provide an alternative
approach to winding up the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following the review of the transaction, a range of directions may be
issued, such as directing the transacting party to transfer or dispose
of his equity interest in the entity or directing the entity to restrict
disclosure of confidential information to any person.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Why is there a two-year time bar?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The two-year time bar seeks to strike a balance between providing a sufficient
runway to commence a review under the Significant Investments Review Act
if a national security incident occurs after an ownership or control transaction
has occurred, while giving investors certainty as to when transactions
would no longer be subject to such powers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This does not prevent actions which may be brought under separate legislation,
such as the Insolvency, Restructuring &amp; Dissolution Act.</p>
