<h4><strong>What is the Significant Investments Review Act?</strong></h4>
<p>As an open economy, Singapore can be vulnerable to actors that may seek
to undermine our national security interests through ownership and control
of critical business entities. It is therefore important to have adequate
and effective investment management measures to safeguard our national
security, and to ensure our economy remains resilient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Significant Investments Review Act (SIRA) complements existing sectoral
legislation and manages threats posed by significant investments into critical
entities, to safeguard Singapore's national security interests. This will
provide businesses and investors with continued confidence in Singapore
as a stable, trusted, and well-connected global business and investment
hub.</p>
