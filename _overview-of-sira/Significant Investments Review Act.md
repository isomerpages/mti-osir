<h4><strong>What is the Significant Investments Review Act?</strong></h4>
<p>As an open economy, Singapore can be vulnerable to actors that may seek
to undermine our national security interests through ownership and control
of critical business entities. It is therefore important to have adequate
and effective investment management measures to safeguard our national
security, and to ensure our economy remains resilient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Significant Investments Review Act (SIRA) is an Act that protects
the national security interests of Singapore by regulating significant
investments in, and control of, critical entities. This will provide businesses
and investors with added confidence in Singapore as a stable, trusted,
and well-connected global business and investment hub.</p>
