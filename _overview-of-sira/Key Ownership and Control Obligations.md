</p><p>Under SIRA, the Minister is allowed to exercise oversight over ownership or control changes involving parties in positions to influence and direct the actions of the designated entities. </p>
	
<p>Notification or approval obligations will be imposed on prospective controllers, existing controllers, and designated entities; based on specific thresholds that may take reference from existing sectoral legislation. These thresholds may be varied on an entity-by-entity basis. If applicable, they will be prescribed in subsidiary legislation.</p>
	
<p>The notification or approval obligations will not apply retroactively, but only to new ownership or control changes after the entities have been designated.</p>

<p> Should prospective or existing controllers proceed with the transactions without seeking the necessary prior approvals from Minister, the transactions are automatically rendered void. </p>

Under SIRA, designated entities are required to seek approval for the appointment of key officers such as the chief executive officer, directors, and the chairperson of the board. Such officers may be removed if they have been appointed without approval or if conditions of approval are breached. The Minister may also remove key officers in the interest of national security.</p>
