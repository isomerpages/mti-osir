</p><p>Under SIRA, the Minister is allowed to exercise oversight over ownership or control changes involving parties in positions to influence and direct the actions of the designated entities. </p>
	
<p>Notification or approval obligations will be imposed on prospective controllers, existing controllers, and designated entities; based on specific thresholds that may take reference from existing sectoral legislation. These thresholds may be varied on an entity-by-entity basis. If applicable, they will be prescribed in subsidiary legislation.</p>
	
<p>The notification or approval obligations will not apply retroactively, but only to new ownership or control changes after the entities have been designated.</p>

<p> Should prospective or existing controllers proceed with the transactions without seeking the necessary prior approvals from Minister, the transactions are automatically rendered void. </p>

</p><p>Under section 28 of SIRA, if a key officer of a designated entity was appointed without the necessary approval, or if any condition of approval has been breached, the appointed key officer can be removed. The Minister can also remove any key officer if deemed necessary in the interest of national security.
