<p>SIRA is designed to be business-friendly and sets out clear processes
for parties that wish to seek reconsideration from Minister for his decisions,
and to make further appeals to an independent Reviewing Tribunal.</p>
<h4><strong>Reconsideration requests</strong></h4>
<p>Parties may submit a reconsideration request against decisions, remedial
directions or orders issued by the Minister for Trade &amp; Industry or
the Relevant Minister.</p>
<p>A decision, remedial direction or order issued by the Minister for Trade
&amp; Industry or the Relevant Minister remains in effect, despite any
reconsideration application made, until it is suspended, varied, or cancelled
(as the case may be).</p>
<h4><strong>Appeals</strong></h4>
<p>If the reconsideration application was unsuccessful, parties may wish
to appeal against the Minister's decision by filing an appeal to the Reviewing
Tribunal <strong><u>within 14 calendar days</u></strong> after the Minister's
decision.</p>
