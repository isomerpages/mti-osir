<p>Transactions that are completed without the necessary prior approvals
from Minister will be void. Materially affected parties may apply to the
Minister to validate the transaction and the Minister may do so by issuing
a validation notice. The Minister may also proactively issue such a notice
if the Minister is satisfied that it is in the interest of Singapore's
national security to do so.</p>
