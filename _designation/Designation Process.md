<h4><strong>Designation Process</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Entities considered for designation under SIRA will be formally notified
with a Notice of Intention to Designate. Entities will be given the opportunity
to make representations relating to their potential designation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the eventual decision is to proceed with designation, the entity will
be issued a Designation Order and their designation status will be notified
in the Government Gazette <strong><u>here</u></strong>. The Designation
Order may contain information specific to each designated entity.</p>
<p></p>

<h4><strong>Designation Criteria</strong></h4>
<p>Designation is not a process treated lightly and is only done when deemed
necessary in the interests of Singapore’s national security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various factors will be taken into consideration in deciding which entities
should be considered for designation. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether the entity provides a critical function in relation to Singapore’s
national security interests; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the entity is adequately covered by sectoral legislation.</p>
<hr>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cancellation of Designation</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Should a designated entity cease to meet the criteria for designation,
cancellation of its designation may be possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any designation, or cancellation of designation, will be published in
the Government Gazette. OSIR will also maintain and publish an updated
list of designated entities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
