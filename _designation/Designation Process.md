<h4><strong>Designation Process</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Entities considered for designation under SIRA will be formally notified
with a Notice of Intention to Designate. Entities will be given the opportunity
to make representations relating to their potential designation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the eventual decision is to proceed with designation, the entity will
be issued a Notice of Designation and their designation status will be
notified in the <a href="https://www.egazette.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Gazette</a> and
updated in the <a href="/designation/designated-entities" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">list of designated entities</a>.
The Designation Order may contain information specific to each designated
entity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Designation Criteria</strong></h4>
<p>Designation is not a process treated lightly and will only be done, if
necessary, in the interest of Singapore’s national security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various factors will be taken into consideration in deciding which entities
should be considered for designation. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether the entity provides a critical function in relation to Singapore’s
national security interests, such as the delivery of essential goods or
services to Singapore; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the entity is adequately covered by sectoral legislation.</p>
<hr>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cancellation of Designation</strong></h4>
<p>Should a designated entity cease to meet the criteria for designation,
the cancellation of its designation may be possible.</p>
<p>Any designation, or cancellation of designation, will be published in
the <a href="https://www.egazette.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Gazette</a>.
OSIR will also maintain and publish an updated <a href="/designation/designated-entities" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">list of designated entities</a>.</p>
